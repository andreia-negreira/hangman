# Hangman Game

This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic game Hangman, created using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game allows players to guess letters to uncover a hidden word, while attempting to avoid too many incorrect guesses that would result in the hanging of a stick figure.

## How to Play

1. Run the main.py file in a Python environment.
2. The game will start by selecting a random word from a pre-defined list.
3. You will be presented with a series of underscores representing each letter in the word. Your goal is to guess the word by suggesting letters.
4. Enter a letter guess and press Enter.
5. If your guess is correct, the underscores will be replaced with the correctly guessed letter in all appropriate positions.
6. If your guess is incorrect, you will receive a message indicating that you have made an incorrect guess, and one life will be discounted.
7. Continue guessing letters until you have successfully guessed the word.
8. If you did not guess the word before you ran out of lives, you lose the game. Otherwise, you win!

## Dependencies

This Hangman game implementation does not require any external libraries or dependencies. It only uses Python's built-in modules.

## Personal situation

The Hangman game implementation was created on 14/06/2023 by Andreia Negreira as part of the AI Boocamp at BeCode.org. The code is provided as an educational example and can be modified and expanded upon to suit different requirements and preferences.

**Enjoy playing Hangman!**
